# Issues

* factions do not have sameAs
* "faction" in url -> replace with parl-group
* some comissions do not have council (rat_id) -> they are missing in lod.lobbywatch -> why?
* political parties -> can we match them with lindas (sameAs) ?
* https://lod.lobbywatch.ch/person/806 -> has gender as "f"/"m"

# Further tests:
* all SPARQL queries run and make sense
* sameAS works with SPARQL

# Ideas:
* persons unmatched: https://s.zazuko.com/aso4cC -> can we do sth?
* Can we match LobbyOrganization with Zefix?
